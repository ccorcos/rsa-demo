# RSA Tutorial

This program explains and demonstrates RSA public-private-key encryption. There are two programs
you can run.

`rsa-simple.py` is very simple and inuitive to follow the code. However it is incredibly ineffient and impractical.

`rsa.py` contains efficient algorithms and also walks you through creating a public-private key pair and encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Getting Started

    git clone https://github.com/ccorcos/rsa-tutorial.git

    python rsa.py

Have a go with some of these prime numbers for creating your keys:


    p = 41
    q = 31
    e = 17

    p = 5915587277
    q = 1500450271
    e = 3267000013

    p = 22953686867719691230002707821868552601124472329079
    q = 30762542250301270692051460539586166927291732754961
    e = 53542885039615245271174355315623704334284773568199
